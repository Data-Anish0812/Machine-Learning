# Linear Regression
This project uses linear regression to predict house prices based on the USA Housing dataset. The dataset includes various features such as the number of rooms, location, and other factors that influence the price of a house. I employed linear regression to build a predictive model that estimates house values based on these input variables. Through data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, this project demonstrates the application of basic machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem. It is a first-step project to showcase skills in data analysis, model building, and performance assessment
# Logistic Regression
This project uses logistic regression to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on the Titanic dataset. The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, class, and other factors that could influence survival chances. I performed label encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical values, allowing the logistic regression model to interpret the data effectively. Through data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, this project demonstrates the application of logistic regression to a classification problem. It serves as a foundational project to showcase skills in data cleaning, encoding, and building predictive models for binary outcomes.
# KNN
This project demonstrates the application of k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for predicting advertising clicks. Using a dataset containing various user features and ad impressions, the model classifies whether a user will click on an ad based on the similarities between the new data point and its nearest neighbors. KNN, a simple yet effective supervised learning algorithm, is utilized to identify patterns and make predictions based on labeled historical data. The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation, showcasing the effectiveness of KNN for classification tasks in advertising click prediction.
