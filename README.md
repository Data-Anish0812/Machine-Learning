# Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn using Logistic Regression, a statistical model designed to estimate the likelihood of a customer leaving a service. The dataset was analyzed and preprocessed, followed by the application of Logistic Regression to predict churn. Cross-validation was implemented to evaluate model performance and avoid overfitting, ensuring the model's robustness. Key features influencing customer churn were identified by examining both positive and negative coefficients of the model, providing valuable insights into customer behavior. The project demonstrates practical implementation of machine learning for business analytics and decision-making in customer retention strategies.
# Breast Cancer Classification
Breast cancer classification model using Logistic Regression to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors based on various features. The model utilizes the well-known Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, which includes attributes like tumor size, shape, and texture, to predict whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). The code demonstrates data preprocessing, feature scaling, model training, evaluation, and performance metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix to assess the classifier's effectiveness. This project aims to provide a simple yet robust approach for early cancer detection, helping to highlight the potential of machine learning in healthcare diagnostics.
# Heart Disease Prediction
This project focuses on predicting heart disease using a logistic regression model. The process begins with thorough data cleaning, where missing values and outliers were handled to ensure a high-quality dataset. Data preprocessing techniques such as label encoding and one-hot encoding were applied to convert categorical features into a format suitable for modeling. Visualization was then employed to explore the dataset and identify key patterns and correlations. Finally, a logistic regression model was trained to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health-related factors, and its performance was evaluated using accuracy and other relevant metrics. This project provides insights into the predictive power of logistic regression for medical diagnoses, particularly in the context of heart disease.
# Loan Approval Prediction System
**Loan Approval Prediction system** was developed using Logistic Regression to determine whether a loan application would be approved. The dataset underwent thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including correlation analysis to uncover key relationships between features. Label encoding was applied to categorical variables to ensure proper model input. The decision was made to use Logistic Regression instead of Decision Tree, which was found to overfit the data. The project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in the financial domain, with a focus on data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation. This system aims to provide an efficient and accurate tool for financial institutions in loan decision-making processes.
# Linear Regression on USA housing data
Linear Regression on USA housing data uses linear regression to predict house prices based on the USA Housing dataset. The dataset includes various features such as the number of rooms, location, and other factors that influence the price of a house. I employed linear regression to build a predictive model that estimates house values based on these input variables. Through data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, this project demonstrates the application of basic machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem. It is a first-step project to showcase skills in data analysis, model building, and performance assessment
# K Mean on Mall Customer
K Mean on Mall Customer applies K-means clustering to customer data from a retail mall, aiming to identify and categorize customers into 5 distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographics. Using the K-means algorithm, we analyze patterns in customer transactions, such as frequency, monetary value, and product preferences. By clustering the data into five segments, the model helps in uncovering meaningful insights about different types of customers, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized offerings for each customer group. This analysis aids businesses in optimizing their strategies and improving customer engagement.
# Titanic Survival Analysis & Prediction 
**Titanic Survival Analysis & Prediction** This project focuses on predicting Titanic passenger survival using various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The dataset, available from Kaggle, contains features such as passenger demographics and class, which are explored through extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships within the data. Following the EDA, the data is used to train the models, and their performance is evaluated based on precision, accuracy, and F1 score. The results are visualized using a seaborn bar graph to facilitate a clear comparison of the algorithms' effectiveness. This project highlights the process of data exploration, model building, and evaluation in a classification task.
# Advertisement Click Prediction
Advertisement Click Prediction project aims to predict whether users will click on advertisements using machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The dataset, which includes features such as user demographics, time of interaction, and ad characteristics, undergoes extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key patterns influencing ad clicks. After preprocessing the data, various models are trained and evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results are visually compared through graphs (e.g., seaborn bar charts), providing insights into each algorithm's performance in this classification task.
# SVM on Salary Prediction
Salary Prediction using SVM focuses on predicting salary based on various factors such as years of experience, education level, and job position using machine learning algorithms. The primary algorithm used is Support Vector Machine (SVM), a powerful technique for both classification and regression tasks, which helps in building a model that predicts salary with high accuracy.Additionally, to compare the performance, I implemented a Random Forest model, known for its robust handling of complex relationships in the data and resistance to overfitting. By evaluating the accuracy of both models, this project demonstrates which algorithm performs better for salary prediction. The results provide insights into how different machine learning models can be leveraged for real-world prediction tasks.
