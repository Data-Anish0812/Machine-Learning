# Linear Regression
This project uses linear regression to predict house prices based on the USA Housing dataset. The dataset includes various features such as the number of rooms, location, and other factors that influence the price of a house. I employed linear regression to build a predictive model that estimates house values based on these input variables. Through data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, this project demonstrates the application of basic machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem. It is a first-step project to showcase skills in data analysis, model building, and performance assessment
