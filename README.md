# Linear Regression on USA housing data
Linear Regression on USA housing data uses linear regression to predict house prices based on the USA Housing dataset. The dataset includes various features such as the number of rooms, location, and other factors that influence the price of a house. I employed linear regression to build a predictive model that estimates house values based on these input variables. Through data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, this project demonstrates the application of basic machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem. It is a first-step project to showcase skills in data analysis, model building, and performance assessment
# K Mean on Mall Customer
K Mean on Mall Customer applies K-means clustering to customer data from a retail mall, aiming to identify and categorize customers into 5 distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior and demographics. Using the K-means algorithm, we analyze patterns in customer transactions, such as frequency, monetary value, and product preferences. By clustering the data into five segments, the model helps in uncovering meaningful insights about different types of customers, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized offerings for each customer group. This analysis aids businesses in optimizing their strategies and improving customer engagement.
# Logistic Regression on Titanic Survival 
Logistic Regression on Titanic Survival data uses logistic regression to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on the Titanic dataset. The dataset includes various features such as age, gender, class, and other factors that could influence survival chances. I performed label encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical values, allowing the logistic regression model to interpret the data effectively. Through data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation, this project demonstrates the application of logistic regression to a classification problem. It serves as a foundational project to showcase skills in data cleaning, encoding, and building predictive models for binary outcomes.
# KNN on Advertising clicks
Advertising click prediction using KNN and Random forest as well as Decision Tree uses a dataset containing various user features and ad impressions, the model classifies whether a user will click on an ad based on the similarities between the new data point and its nearest neighbors. KNN, a simple yet effective supervised learning algorithm, is utilized to identify patterns and make predictions based on labeled historical data. The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation, showcasing the effectiveness of KNN for classification tasks in advertising click prediction.
# SVM on Salary Prediction
Salary Prediction using SVM focuses on predicting salary based on various factors such as years of experience, education level, and job position using machine learning algorithms. The primary algorithm used is Support Vector Machine (SVM), a powerful technique for both classification and regression tasks, which helps in building a model that predicts salary with high accuracy.Additionally, to compare the performance, I implemented a Random Forest model, known for its robust handling of complex relationships in the data and resistance to overfitting. By evaluating the accuracy of both models, this project demonstrates which algorithm performs better for salary prediction. The results provide insights into how different machine learning models can be leveraged for real-world prediction tasks.
